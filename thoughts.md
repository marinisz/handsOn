# So basically, by looking at the degree distribution of the graph we created, we can tell that it has some nodes with a lot of connections and many nodes with only a few connections. This is pretty common in real-life networks, like social networks or the Internet.

# One cool thing about our graph is that all the nodes are connected to each other in some way. This is important because it means that information can easily travel between nodes, which is super useful for things like communication or transportation.

# Overall, using NetworkX and checking out the summary and degree distribution of our graph taught us a lot about its structure and features. This information can be super helpful for figuring out how to make the network work better for different situations.
